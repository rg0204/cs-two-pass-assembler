SIC/XE Assembler using program.txt
-> program.txt is attached and is input to our source code (180101055_Assign2_assembler.cpp)
-> on running source code will generate three files intermediateFile.txt, listFile.txt, symbolTable.txt and objectFile.txt which are intermediate file, listing file, symbol Table file and object code file respectively
-> To run the source code
    Command To compile the source code : g++ 190101069_Assign2_assembler.cpp
    Command to execute : ./a.out

Linker-Loader using linker_input.txt
-> linker_input.txt is attached and is input to our source code (180101055_Assign2_linker_loader.cpp)
-> on running source code will generate three files esTableFile.txt and pass2LinkerFile.txt which are ES Table file and memory table file respectively
-> To run the source code
    Command To compile the source code : g++ 190101069_Assign2_linker_loader.cpp
